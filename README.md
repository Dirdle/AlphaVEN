# AlphaVEN

Alpha Video ENcoder (AlphaVEN) is a freely availble video editing tool used by the team at Sector Alpha

For now, development is underway for a command line tool, to feature many commonly used video editing methods including
   1) appending videos
   2) splitting videos
   3) incorporating fade in and fadeout transitions

Much more work to do on this, but this is a good start
