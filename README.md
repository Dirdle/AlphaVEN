# AlphaVEN

Alpha Video ENcoder (AlphaVEN) is a freely availble video editing tool used by the team at Sector Alpha

## Features

For now, development is underway for a command line tool, to feature many commonly used video editing methods including
   - appending videos.
   - splitting videos.
   - incorporating fade in and fadeout transitions.

Much more work to do on this, but this is a good start. The syntax is to be kept as verbose as possible and cut to the chase. Simplicity is the key focus of this

## TODO

  - alter the duration of fading in and fading out.
  - incorporate whether a merge should occur or not (maybe you just want to extract lots of videos from a single source video)
